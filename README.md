## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardwares is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but struggling to compete with other companies using data effectively. The company heavily relies on Excel for reporting, limiting its ability to gain actionable insights. This project aimed to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders across departments make informed decisions based on data.

## Key Objectives
The project focused on developing one report for stakeholders from the sales, marketing, finance, and executive teams. The main goals included:
1. **Robust Data Modeling**
2. **User-Centric Report Design**
3. **Drillable Insights for Better Decision-Making**

## Features and Learning Outcomes

- **Power Query**: 
  - Applied basic and advanced operations for data transformation.
  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: 
  - Created both simple and complex DAX formulas to calculate KPIs.
  
- **Data Modeling**: 
  - Integrated over 10+ tables with proper relationships to support the analysis.
  
- **Visualization**: 
  - Selected appropriate visuals (charts, graphs, tables) and formatted them to convey clear insights.
  
- **Dashboard Design**: 
  - Followed best practices in dashboard design for easy navigation and better user experience.
